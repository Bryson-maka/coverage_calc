# Carbon Implement Coverage Calculator

This Streamlit application calculates the coverage of a farm implement as it traverses a field, accounting for turnaround time at the end of each pass. It provides insights into total area covered and time spent turning around for various operational parameters.

## Key Calculations and Methodology

### 1. Unit Conversions

The calculator supports both metric and imperial units. All calculations are performed in metric units, with conversions applied as needed:

- 1 foot = 0.3048 meters
- 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers
- 1 acre = 0.404686 hectares

### 2. Coverage Per Pass

```
coverage_per_pass = (machine_width * field_length) / 10000  # hectares
```

This calculation determines the area covered in a single pass across the field. The result is divided by 10,000 to convert square meters to hectares.

### 3. Time Per Pass

```
time_per_pass = field_length / (machine_speed * 1000 / 60)  # minutes
```

This calculates how long it takes to complete one pass. Note that machine speed is converted from km/h to m/min.

### 4. Turnarounds Per Hour

```
total_turnarounds_per_hour = 60 / (time_per_pass + turn_around_time)
```

This determines how many full cycles (pass + turnaround) can be completed in an hour.

### 5. Coverage Per Hour

```
coverage_per_hour = (60 / (time_per_pass + turn_around_time)) * coverage_per_pass
```

This calculates the total area covered in an hour, accounting for both productive time (passing) and non-productive time (turning around).

### 6. Time Spent Turning Around

```
time_spent_turning_around_per_hour = total_turnarounds_per_hour * turn_around_time
```

This computes the cumulative time spent on turnarounds within an hour.

### 7. Daily and Weekly Calculations

The calculator extends hourly calculations to daily and weekly figures by multiplying with operational hours per day and operational days per week, respectively.

## Potential Areas of Scrutiny

1. **Ideal Conditions Assumption**: The model assumes consistent speed and perfect efficiency, which may not reflect real-world variations due to terrain, obstacles, or operator fatigue.

2. **Linear Field Assumption**: The calculator assumes a rectangular field with no irregularities. Real fields may have varying shapes or obstacles that affect coverage patterns.

3. **Constant Turn Time**: The model uses a fixed turnaround time, which might not account for variations in turning radius or operator skill.

4. **No Overlap Consideration**: The calculation doesn't account for potential overlap between passes, which is often necessary in practice to ensure complete coverage.

5. **Simplified Speed Model**: The calculator uses a constant speed, not accounting for acceleration/deceleration at the start/end of each pass.

6. **Rounding Effects**: Results are rounded to improve readability, which may introduce minor discrepancies in very precise calculations.

7. **No Efficiency Factor**: The model doesn't include an efficiency factor to account for non-ideal conditions or operator breaks.

## Limitations and Considerations

- The calculator provides a theoretical maximum coverage based on input parameters.
- Actual field coverage may vary due to environmental factors, equipment limitations, and operator behavior.
- Users should consider these calculations as estimates and adjust expectations based on specific field conditions and operational realities.

By understanding these calculations and potential areas of scrutiny, users can make more informed decisions about implement coverage and operational planning.
